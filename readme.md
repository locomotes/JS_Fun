Also, create another JS file in your JS homework repo from last night and I want you do do the following in it.

Preform some simple operations with numbers
Preform some simple conditional statements using "if" and "else" and make sure to use variables
Create 10 different objects whose properties have a mix of the following value types (you must use each one at least once)
                -  Number
                -  String
                -  Array
                -  Function
                -  Object

Make sure for all of your JS homework you are commenting what you are doing. I should be able to read it and learn about what you were thinking and why. Please have some fun with this, don't create arbitrary words but create something meaningful... like a person object or an animal object etc.

Homework for tonight:

1. Make sure all of your current homework is complete and that you have a STRONG understanding of the work we have done so far. If not please touch base with Shane or myself. 

2. Set up a basic HTML page linked properly to a JavaScript file and write out some of the following:

Declare 5 different variables and have them write to the console
Declare 3 different variables who have a value type of a string and use the following on them:
.split()
.concat()
.length
Declare an array with at least 10 elements and use the following on them:
.push()
.pop()
.join()
.reverse()
.splice()
Declare a function that does ALL of the above and call it in your file

Lastly, (and most importantly) with each statement that you write, make sure you put a comment above it saying what you are doing in your own words. Get used to commenting your code so others know what you are doing.
Make sure to create a new repo on Github and call it something like “JS Intro”, push it up and link to the repo below when completed.
