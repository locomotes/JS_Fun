Homework for tonight:

1. Make sure all of your current homework is complete and that you have a STRONG understanding of the work we have done so far. If not please touch base with Shane or myself. 

2. Set up a basic HTML page linked properly to a JavaScript file and write out some of the following:

Declare 5 different variables and have them write to the console
Declare 3 different variables who have a value type of a string and use the following on them:
.split()
.concat()
.length
Declare an array with at least 10 elements and use the following on them:
.push()
.pop()
.join()
.reverse()
.splice()
Declare a function that does ALL of the above and call it in your file

Lastly, (and most importantly) with each statement that you write, make sure you put a comment above it saying what you are doing in your own words. Get used to commenting your code so others know what you are doing.
Make sure to create a new repo on Github and call it something like “JS Intro”, push it up and link to the repo below when completed.
